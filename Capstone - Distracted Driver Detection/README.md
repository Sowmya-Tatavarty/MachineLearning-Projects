## Distracted Driver Detection

As part of Machine Learning Nano Degree, I am working on completing a Capstone Project, to leverage what I have learned thought the Nanodegree program to author a proposal and solve a problem of my choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques.

Distracted driving is a growing public safety hazard.  The dramatic rise in texting and constant updates from social media platforms appear to be contributing to an alarming increase in distracted driving fatalities. It accounts for approximately 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. These deaths all stem from a cause that is entirely preventable. Legislation enacting distracted driving bans should be paired with effective enforcement to dissuade drivers from distractions while driving. Providing tools to alert users when they are distracted can make the user self-aware of his/her actions and notice the frequency at which they are getting distracted while driving so that they can take steps to reduce or remove the sources of distraction.

In this project, we will use dashboard cameras images to detect drivers engaging in distracted behaviors. Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images by State Farm in the Kaggle challenge we will classify each driver's behavior. Are they driving attentively, wearing their seatbelt, or taking a selfie with their friends in the back seat?
