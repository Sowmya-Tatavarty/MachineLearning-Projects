# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Distracted Driver Detection

As part of Machine Learning Nano Degree, I am working on completing a Capstone Project, to leverage what I have learned thought the Nanodegree program to author a proposal and solve a problem of my choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques.

In this project, we will use dashboard cameras images to detect drivers engaging in distracted behaviors. Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images by State Farm in the Kaggle challenge we will classify each driver's behavior. Are they driving attentively, wearing their seatbelt, or taking a selfie with their friends in the back seat?


### Data

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle  [Kaggle - State Farm Distracted Drive Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data)

**File Descriptions**

	img.zip - zipped folder of all (train/text) images
	sample_submissions.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
	driver_imgs_list.csv - a list of training images 


Download the files and extract imgs.zip to 'Distracted_Data' folder in the current working directory.
Read the Project report and open "Project summary" python notebook to review models trained and their accuracies.
Project summary has the option to load saved models to regenerate submission files. Submit the results in the Kaggle competition and view the score

Submissions folder has submissions made to get the score mentioned in the project report document and project summary IPython notebook.
